# Task Hook examples

In CloudBees CD/RO Version 2023.10 we will be introducing the Task Hook feature. This feature allows developers to add a procedure call or command block to task definitions that will be executed as the last step of the task's job. This is useful for extending the functionality of plugins and for Third-party deployers. In both case, the feature makes it possible to parse the logs of that task. In the case of plugins this make it possible to implement postp-like functionality. In the case of Third-party deployers it make it possible to extract details of what was deployed from the logs in order to update environment inventory.

- [CI_Deploy_parse_procedure.groovy](https://github.com/electric-cloud-community/DSL-Samples/blob/master/TaskHook/CI_Deploy_parse_procedure.groovy) Can be used as the task hook command block to parse a CI Task logfile. If the task is set as a Deploy operation, the artifact data extracted from the logfile will be used for environment inventory
- [TaskHookSampleRelease.groovy](https://github.com/electric-cloud-community/DSL-Samples/blob/master/TaskHook/TaskHookSampleRelease.groovy) Is a release model which includes Deploy tasks use a procedure to simulate the logfiles from a deployment. That data is used to update environment inventory.
